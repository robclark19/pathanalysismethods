```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

Two examples of systems in which SEM (Path analysis) can be used to investigate the strength of indirect effects
in agricultural systems.

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
summary(iris)

```

## Plots

Embedded plot section

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
